# X-CUBE-USB-PD
Firmware X-Cube-USB-PD for STM32F0 Nucleo board named P-NUCLEO-USB001   
    (STM32CubeExpansion_USBPD_F0)

Purpose:
--------
USB type-C (USB-C) and USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) controller based on STM32

Description:
--------
This is the firmware using STM32 and GPIO pins to behave as a USB Type-C + PD controller.

No specific USB-PD IC is required. Everything is managed by software. Making this discrete solution a low cost USB-PD controller.
Just few external component are required like resitors, capacitors, and Mosfets.

This solution from the silicon provider (STMicro) has been certified by the official USB organisation (USB-IF: USB implementer forum).
It only works on STM32 microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M based).

Hardware:
--------
Development board: P-NUCLEO-USB001  
Device: STM32F072  
Provider: STMicroelectronics

--------
X Cube USB PD
Discrete or STUSB1602
