@par Application Description
This application is a part of the USB Power Delivery package using STM32Cube 
firmware. It describes how to use USB Power Delivery (USBPD) consumer application
based on the STM32F072RB devices.

When the application starts, connecting an USB-C provider device (source mode) 
should trigger the power negotiation:
 - At start, Role LED (LED D203) will be blinking until cable attach and VBUS Green 
   LED (D 204) is off.
   User should plug the USB-C cable on the dedicated connector:
 - When attached, CC LEDs (D202, D205) will blink once if connected on CC1, twice 
   if connected on CC2.
 - Blue LED (D203) will be blinking twice each time, to show that the device behaves 
   as a consumer.

The STM32 MCU behaves as a Consumer (Sink mode), it waits for Power Capabilities message 
from the attached provider. When a Source Capabilities message is received, the STM32 
starts the evaluation of the received capabilities and check if one of the received power 
objects can meet its power requirement: 
 - While Communicating, VBUS LED (D204) will be blinking.
   The STM32 shall send the Request message to request the new power level from the offered 
   Source Capabilities.
 - Once the Explicit Contract established (PS_Ready) message received), VBUS LED (D 204) 
   is on to indicate that the Power Contract was established.


The system can manage two supply options for the Consumer configuration. 
The first one is supplied by NUCLEO-F072RB, while the second implements a specific 
feature of the USB PD solutions (i.e. when a Consumer is supplied by the Provider by 
mean of its VBUS). Both configurations correspond to two different setting:
If the Consumer is supplied by mean of NUCLEO-F072RB voltage regulator, the system 
setting is the following one:
 – On NUCLEO-F072RB board, verify that the jumper JP1 is open, JP5 (PWR) closed on 
   U5V (fitting the pins 1-2), and JP6 (IDD) closed.
 – On P-NUCLEO-USB001 expansion board, open the jumpers JP100, J500, JP501.
   If the Consumer is supplied by mean of the VBUS delivered by the Provider attached 
   by the USB Type-C cable, the system setting is the following one:
 – On the NUCLEO-F072RB board, the jumper JP1 must be closed, JP5 (PWR) closed on 
   E5V (fitting the pins 2-3), and JP6 (IDD) closed.
 – On P-NUCLEO-USB001 expansion board, while the jumpers J500, JP501 are opened, 
   the jumper JP100 must be set according to the port chosen for supplying the system 
   (fit 2-3 for PORT_0 or 1-2 for PORT_1).

      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F072RB devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC
    boards with the P-NUCLEO-USB001 shield RevB connected to CN7 and CN10 connectorsand can 
	be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to the USB-C Power Delivery Provider through
    USB typeC cable to the connector CN0 in the P-NUCLEO-USB001 shield.
	To test this application, the Provider_RTOS application can be used as a provider 
	
  - STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC Set-up
    - Note that some PCB rework is needed to use the P-NUCLEO-USB001 shield
			- SB48, SB49, SB62 and SB63 must be closed
			- SB13, SB14, SB15 and SB21 must be removed
			- R34 and R36 must be removed
			- JP5 Jumper must be connected to U5V.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open EWARM toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
